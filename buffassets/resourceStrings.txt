//BuffManual_Summary
BuffManual_Summary_Content_0|Random Buff is a game mode that is played with a random mix of gain effects. You can add challenges for yourself or complete special missions to unlock rewards.
BuffManual_Gameplay_Content_0|The gameplay is affected to a greater or lesser extent by enabling different buffs. <LINE> Most changes are dynamic, and different buffs can be combined to produce unexpected effects.
BuffManual_Gameplay_Content_1|You can choose from two different modes to play Random Buff, Free Mode and Mission Mode.
BuffManual_Gameplay_Content_2|Different game modes have conditions that can be completed. <LINE> Each condition has its own requirements and progression, and completing them earns different amounts of experience.
BuffManual_FreeMode_Content_0|The most conventional way to play. <LINE>If you succeed in making a settlement, you will only settle experience points to level up based on the completed conditions, number of kills, and number of cards held. <LINE>Sub-modes can be switched in the lower left corner of the screen.
BuffManual_FreeMode_Content_1|You can choose from 0 to 5 conditions to play, each successful rain sleep will be drawn in a round, and the rain sleep will be settled when all conditions are completed. <LINE>No settlement will be made at 0 conditions. <LINE>Depending on the slug cat selected, the initial room is the same as the initial room of the selected slug cat in Drama Mode.
BuffManual_FreeMode_Content_2|The conditions are selected in the same way as normal mode, but a completely randomized draw will be made every 30 seconds. <LINE>The earliest drawn buff will be automatically removed when the number of cards exceeds a certain number.<LINE>The initial room will be randomly selected from all shelters in the current area.
BuffManual_FreeMode_Content_3|Conditions are selected in the same way as normal mode. However, you can choose a certain number of initial buffs when you start the game, and every time you go through a rain cycle after that, an additional negative buff will be added.<LINE>The initial rooms are selected in the same way as in Quick Mode.
BuffManual_FreeMode_Content_4|Conditions are selected in the same way as in normal mode, but no experience will be gained. <LINE> No card draws will take place while the game is in progress, and will be replaced by a sandbox card pack with buffs that can be freely enabled and disabled. <LINE> Initial rooms are selected in the same way as in Normal Mode, and there is no settlement.
BuffManual_FreeMode_Content_5|Details of this mode can be viewed via the button in the lower right corner
BuffManual_MissionMode_Content_0|The mode of fixed conditions and initial gains is divided into generic missions and exclusive missions. <LINE>Exclusive missions can only be completed by specific slug cats, while general missions can be completed by any slug cat. <LINE>Completing missions not only allows you to level up as in Free Mode, but also unlocks special collectibles!
BuffManual_MissionMode_Content_1|There are a total of two missions to choose from above:<LINE> Exclusive mission: can only be completed by the currently selected slugcat<LINE> General mission: can be completed by all slugcats.
BuffManual_MissionMode_Content_2|Each mission has different specified conditions, which can be viewed in the conditions section, and the mission can only be completed if you fulfill the requirements of the conditions.
BuffManual_MissionMode_Content_3|Each mission has a different initial deck, which can be viewed in the deck bar.
BuffManual_MissionMode_Content_4|Details of this mode can be viewed via the button in the lower right corner
BuffManual_BuffAndCard_Content_0|The buffs in the Mod are divided into three main categories: positive, neutral, and negative. <LINE>The effects of different buffs vary greatly, and cards can be used to display information about them. <LINE>Each buff has a card that represents it, and the card can display the cover, name, and details of the buff. <LINE>In addition to this, the cards also have the ability to display other additional information.
BuffManual_BuffAndCard_Content_1|When a circular mark appears on the card, this indicates that the buff is time-sensitive. The number in the <LINE> graphic indicates how many more rain cycles the buff can take effect.
BuffManual_BuffAndCard_Content_2|When a diamond-shaped mark appears on the card, this indicates that the buff is stackable. <LINE>The number in the graphic indicates the current stacking level of the buff <LINE>The exact effect of the stacking level depends on how the different buffs are implemented.
BuffManual_BuffAndCard_Content_3|When a hexagonal mark appears on the card, this indicates that the buff is actively triggerable. <LINE> If the graphic is marked with a >> mark, this indicates that you have not bound any trigger shortcuts to him. <LINE>Shortcuts can be bound by pressing the key specified in the configuration menu. Once bound, you can use the shortcut to trigger the buff. <LINE>Additionally, you can right-click on a card to trigger a buff.
BuffManual_Progression_Content_0|Random Buff has a separate progress system for levels, records, collectibles, and decorations <LINE> where levels are visible on all three pages, with the current level and experience displayed on the left, and the experience needed for the next level displayed on the right.
BuffManual_Progression_Content_1|The logging page displays some special progress that can be used to count the number of events triggered when playing some random buff.
BuffManual_Progression_Content_2|The collectibles screen displays the collection of collectibles. You can hover over the collectibles button to view the details.
BuffManual_Progression_Content_3|The ornament screen displays all the ornaments that have been collected. You can toggle the decorations on and off by clicking the decorations button. Decorations enabled by <LINE> will appear in the game and will only take effect on the slug cat corresponding to the slug cat avatar on the left. Gray avatars are enabled for all cats. <LINE>Enabled ornament buttons have a green color stroke.
BuffManual_CardPedia_Content_0|Card Art can be used to view all the buff cards you've unlocked or drawn <LINE> Also, Card Art can be used to count the progress of your buff card collection.
BuffManual_CardPedia_Content_1|After selecting any type of buff, you can view the details of the corresponding buff by clicking on the buff card.
